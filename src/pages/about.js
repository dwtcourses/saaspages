                  Hey, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/volkandkaya" target="_blank">Volkan Kaya</a>, a developer turned founder from London, UK - creator of SaaS Pages!
                  <br /><br />
                  While working on <a href="https://versoly.com/?ref=saaspages">Versoly</a> a SaaS landing page builder, I had to build great landing pages. I wanted an easy way to see how other SaaS landing pages were designed, laid out and most importantly their copywriting.
                  <br /><br />
                  The aim of this website is to help myself and SaaS companies build the best landing pages so that they can convert visitors to paying customers.
                  <br /><br />
                  I had this idea in my head for a while but seeing great websites on Product Hunt gave me the push I needed to create it.
                  <br /><br />
                  Please checkout <a href="https://www.checklist.design" target="_blank">Checklist Design</a> I borrowed a lot from this website. Also I was inspired by <a href="https://webframe.xyz/" target="_blank">Webframe</a> he was able to build a great site in a week and then rank number 1 on Product Hunt with it.
                  <br /><br />
                  P.S. All code is open source on <a href="https://github.com/volkandkaya/saaspages">Github</a> the code is terrible at the moment. Will need to invest some time cleaning it up.
